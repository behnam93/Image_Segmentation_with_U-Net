# U-Net for Image Segmentation
### Overview
Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves partitioning an image into meaningful segments or objects. The U-Net architecture, originally developed for biomedical image segmentation, has gained widespread adoption due to its ability to achieve precise pixel-wise segmentation.

This repository provides an implementation of U-Net, trained on image-mask pairs, to delineate object boundaries effectively. The model is applicable across various domains, including medical imaging, autonomous driving, satellite imagery, and agricultural monitoring.

### Architecture
####### U-Net follows an encoder-decoder structure:

###### Encoder (Contracting Path): Captures the spatial context using convolutional and max-pooling layers.
###### Decoder (Expanding Path): Reconstructs image details through upsampling and skip connections.
###### Skip Connections: Bridge the encoder and decoder, ensuring fine-grained details are retained for precise segmentation.
###### Dataset & Preprocessing
###### Input: Raw images
###### Ground Truth: Corresponding segmentation masks
###### Preprocessing steps:
###### Resizing images and masks to a fixed dimension
###### Normalization for better model convergence
###### Data augmentation (optional) to improve generalization
