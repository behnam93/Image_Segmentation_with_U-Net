# Image_Segmentation_with_U-Net
Image segmentation divides an image into meaningful regions. U-Net, with its encoder-decoder structure, excels in tasks like medical imaging by learning pixel-wise boundaries from image-mask pairs. Training involves data preprocessing, parameter tuning and IoU evaluation. Its applications span autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis and agriculture.
